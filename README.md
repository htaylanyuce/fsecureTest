Create a program in Python that does the following:

1. Download our support tool: ftp://ftp.f-secure.com/support/tools/fsdiag/fsdiag_standalone.exe.

2. Execute any other program (except the support tool) within the Windows OS.

3. Execute the support tool so it can start gathering logs from the system.

4. Verify that the fsdiag.7z exists in the Desktop.
